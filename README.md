# üéì School Data Processing Repository

## üìú Description

This repository contains a set of Python scripts designed to process, analyze, and consolidate school data from Excel files (.xlsx). The main goal of these scripts is to help efficiently extract, clean, and structure the data from multiple files, allowing for easy analysis and reporting. These scripts focus on student, faculty, and academic year data across various universities and schools.

## üóÇÔ∏è Folder Structure

### 1. **academic_year_analysis**
   - **extract_academic_data.py**: This script processes Excel files from a specified folder, extracts relevant columns (such as STUDENT ID, MEDIUM OF ORIGIN, YEAR OF STUDIES, FACULTY, SPECIALIZATION), adds the academic year based on the file name, and generates a consolidated output file for each folder.
   - **faculty_analysis_report.py**: This script reads the files generated by `extract_academic_data.py`, extracts key statistics by faculty, specialization, and academic year, and creates a final statistical report.

### 2. **school_data_processing**
   - **aggregate_excel_sheets.py**: This script merges multiple Excel files, extracts and cleans the data (such as NAME, SURNAME, FACULTY, COUNTY, COUNTRY), and saves it into a consolidated file.
   - **school_data_normalizer.py**: This script normalizes and groups similar schools by county, removing duplicates and aggregating data for each school, and then saves the results into a new Excel file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Detailed Functionality

### 1. **Extract and Process Academic Data**
   - **extract_academic_data.py**:
     - Extracts the academic year from the file name (using a predefined mapping of year codes).
     - Selects relevant columns such as student ID, faculty, specialization, and study year.
     - Cleans the data by removing incomplete rows.
     - Adds an "Academic Year" column based on the file name.
     - Saves the processed data into a consolidated file per folder.

   - **faculty_analysis_report.py**:
     - Reads the processed files generated by `extract_academic_data.py`.
     - Extracts statistics such as student distribution by faculty, specialization, and academic year.
     - Generates a final report containing these statistics.

### 2. **Merge and Normalize School Data**
   - **aggregate_excel_sheets.py**:
     - Merges data from multiple Excel files, selecting the necessary columns like NAME, SURNAME, FACULTY, COUNTY, COUNTRY.
     - Ensures that missing COUNTY values are filled with the COUNTRY value, if necessary.
     - Saves the merged data into a single output file.

   - **school_data_normalizer.py**:
     - Normalizes and compares school names to group similar schools, removing unnecessary words and city names.
     - Aggregates data for each county, calculating the total number of students per county.
     - Saves the cleaned and grouped data into an Excel file with counties and schools properly merged and summarized.

## üïí Time Saved

Given that you have 30 Excel files, each with 2000 entries and 130 columns, running the scripts **takes a total of 2-3 minutes** for the entire process.

### **Time Saving Analysis**:

- **Without Automation**:
  - Manually processing each of the 30 files would take significant time. Assuming it would take **30 minutes** to process each file manually (including extracting, cleaning, and analyzing the data), the total time required would be:
    - 30 files x 30 minutes = **900 minutes** (15 hours).

- **With the Scripts**:
  - The scripts process all 30 files in a total of **2-3 minutes**.

### **Time Saved (Linear)**:
- **99.87% Time Saved** from manual processing, reducing the time spent from 15 hours to just a few minutes (approximately **898 minutes saved**).

This shows the immense efficiency gained by automating these tasks with the provided scripts!

## üìÇ How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas openpyxl fuzzywuzzy
   ```
3. Place your Excel files in the appropriate folders as required by the scripts.
   - For the `academic_year_analysis` folder:
     - Ensure the files are named in a way that allows the script to extract the academic year correctly (e.g., `export_data_students20.xlsx`).
   - For the `school_data_processing` folder:
     - Ensure the Excel files contain relevant columns like NAME, SURNAME, FACULTY, COUNTY, COUNTRY for merging and normalization.

4. Run the relevant Python scripts:
   - For academic year extraction and faculty analysis, run:
     - `extract_academic_data.py` (located in the `academic_year_analysis` folder)
     - `faculty_analysis_report.py` (also in the `academic_year_analysis` folder)
   
     These scripts will process the academic data, extract the academic year, clean the data, and generate a statistical report.

   - For school data merging and normalization, run:
     - `aggregate_excel_sheets.py` (in the `school_data_processing` folder)
     - `school_data_normalizer.py` (in the `school_data_processing` folder)

     These scripts will merge the data from multiple school Excel files, normalize and group the schools by county, and generate a summarized report.

5. The scripts will automatically generate output files in the same folder, which will include the processed data or the final statistics.
